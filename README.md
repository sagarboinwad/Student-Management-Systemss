Add Students: Allows the user to add new student records.
View Students: View a list of all students and their details.
Update Students: Modify existing student records.
Delete Students: Remove students from the system.
Search Students: Quickly search for students by name or ID.
Persistent Data: Student records are stored locally in a students.json file, ensuring data is preserved across program restarts.
